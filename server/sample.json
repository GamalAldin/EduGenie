            "model_answer": "The PACT framework consists of four key elements: People, Activities, Contexts, and Technologies. This framework is significant in interactive systems design as it emphasizes the interplay between these elements. Designers must understand the characteristics and needs of the users (People), the tasks they aim to accomplish (Activities), the environments in which these tasks take place (Contexts), and the technological resources available (Technologies). Recognizing this interaction helps in creating systems that are user-centered, efficient, and adaptive to real-world scenarios.",

            "question": "What roles do 'Activities' and 'Contexts' play in shaping technology requirements according to the PACT framework?",
            "model_answer": "In the PACT framework, 'Activities' refer to the tasks that users perform, which define the requirements for technology. This includes what users need to accomplish, the steps involved, and the desired outcomes of these tasks. 'Contexts' refer to the environments in which these activities occur, including physical, social, and organizational aspects. By analyzing both activities and contexts, designers can identify user needs more accurately and develop technologies that align well with the real-world situations users encounter, ensuring technology is both practical and functional.",

            "model_answer": "The PACT framework consists of four main components: People, Activities, Contexts, and Technologies. These components interact in the following ways: People engage in Activities using Technologies, and the Contexts define the environment and conditions under which these interactions occur. For instance, when a student uses a phone to send a text message (Technology) while sitting on a bus (Context), the activity of messaging is tailored by both the technical capabilities of the phone and the situational factors of the bus environment.",

            "question": "How does the PACT framework emphasize the importance of design in technology development?",
            "model_answer": "The PACT framework highlights that the design of technology must take into account the requirements established by the activities people undertake and the contexts in which those activities occur. Designers are tasked with creating technologies that not only assist but also enhance these activities. For example, designing software for air traffic controllers requires understanding the dynamic and high-stakes context of managing air traffic, which shapes the design and functionality of the technology.",

            "question": "Illustrate how the PACT framework can present challenges in interactive system design.",
            "model_answer": "The PACT framework presents challenges because the interaction between its components can lead to complex design requirements. For example, designers must consider that diverse user groups (People) have different needs and preferences while engaging in various activities (Activities) within multiple environments (Contexts). This diversity can lead to conflicting requirements, making it difficult to create a universal solution that satisfies all users. The challenge lies in balancing these needs while leveraging technologies effectively.",

            "model_answer": "Understanding the PACT elements enables designers to create user-centered technologies that address real needs. By fully grasping the characteristics of People, the Activities they engage in, the Contexts in which those activities occur, and the available Technologies, designers can make informed decisions that enhance usability and user satisfaction. For example, knowledge of how a 70-year-old interacts with technology can inform design choices that make devices more accessible to older users.",
